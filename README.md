# Browsing history and stats
Jupyter notebook that generates a report of your own safari browsing history and other stats. By following/ by executing, the notebook steps:

The notebook does:
* Has the script to copy your SQL lite Safari database
* Select and filter website history
* cleans the URL data
* Filters the last 7 days
* Generates different graphs depending on your online habits

Other ideas to be implemented:
* Generate a report to see at which times do you often visit more the sites
* Time spent per website
* Add the rest of the web-browsers
* Make it multi-plaform, maybe with [electron](http://electronjs.org)
